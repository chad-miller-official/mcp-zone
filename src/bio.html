          Michael Cera Palin are an emotive indie-punk trio from Atlanta, GA. The band are noted for
          consciously vulnerable lyrics, a cathartically catchy sound, and an impassioned live show,
          all forged through a decade of cutting teeth in the genre-fluid arts landscape of their
          home. Michael Cera Palin’s debut LP, “We Could Be Brave”, displays the band stretching
          their limbs to prove their growth as both musicians and discerning creatives. “Feast or
          Famine”, “Gracious”, “Despite”, & “Wisteria” serve as benchmarks for MCP’s prowess of
          their Midwest Emo roots, each song rich with its own display of the band’s dynamic range.

          MCP released two EPs from 2015-2018 before a premature hiatus. After derailed ambitions
          for their 2020 return (now to a notably larger listenership than they had previously left
          behind), the band retreated from the social dimension of the community to begin carving
          their new chapter, and finding a voice of their own. They then released 2 singles, before
          starting toward an accelerating tour ethic since 2022, diligently assuring fans along the
          way that a debut full-length album would be with them in due time. Whether owed to or
          despite their limited output, Michael Cera Palin’s work continues to accrue fervent
          support, with mounting anticipation of their new material.
